        <h1>The Story in the Book</h1>
        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist,</em> and all the other scientific journals her work had appeard in was a well thumbled copy of <em>On The Road.</em> It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt needed to be free.</p>
        <p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote procaliming that "Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do". Although many considered her pioneering work, unravelling the secrets of the llama <u style="text-decoration:underline dotted;text-underline-position:under">DNA</u>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did</em> thimk she had something better to do.</p>
